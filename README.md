## Installation

### Prerequisites before Installation

1.  **Domain Name:** You need a registered domain name (e.g., `yourdomain.com`).
2.  **DNS Configuration:** Before running the installation script, you **must** configure DNS A-record for your domain, pointing to the public IP address of the server where you'll install this system. Replace `yourdomain.com` with your actual domain:
    - **Wildcard Record:** `A *.yourdomain.com` -> `YOUR_SERVER_IP`
3.  **VPS (Virtual Private Server):** A dedicated VPS with a public IP address is required. Home servers, shared hosting, or localhost setups are not supported.
    - **Operating System:** Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, 64-bit — or Arch Linux / CachyOS (64-bit). The installer auto-detects the package family from `/etc/os-release` and uses `apt` on Debian/Ubuntu and `pacman` on Arch-based systems.
    - For a minimal setup with **n8n, Monitoring, Databasus and Portainer**: **4 GB Memory / 2 CPU Cores / 40 GB Disk Space**
    - For running **all available services**: at least **20 GB Memory / 4 CPU Cores / 60 GB Disk Space**

### Running the Install

The recommended way to install is using the provided main installation script.

1.  Connect to your server via SSH.
2.  Run the following command:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kossakovsky/selfhost-ai && cd selfhost-ai && sudo bash ./scripts/install.sh
    ```

This single command automates the entire setup process, including:

- Preparing your system (updates, firewall configuration, and basic security enhancements like brute-force protection).
- Installing Docker and Docker Compose (tools for running applications in isolated environments).
- Generating a configuration file (`.env`) with necessary secrets and your domain settings.
- Launching all the services.

During the installation, the script will prompt you for:

1.  Your **primary domain name** (Required, e.g., `yourdomain.com`). This is the domain for which you've configured the wildcard DNS record.
2.  Your **email address** (Required, used for service logins like Flowise, Supabase dashboard, Grafana, and for SSL certificate registration with Let's Encrypt).
3.  An optional **OpenAI API key** (Not required. If provided, it can be used by Supabase AI features and Crawl4ai. Press Enter to skip).
4.  Whether you want to **import ~300 ready-made n8n community workflows** (y/n, Optional. This can take 20-30 minutes, depending on your server and network speed).
5.  The **number of n8n workers** you want to run (Required, e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4. This determines how many workflows can be processed in parallel. Each worker automatically gets its own dedicated task runner sidecar for executing Code nodes. Defaults to 1 if not specified).
6.  A **Service Selection Wizard** will then appear, allowing you to choose which of the available services (like Flowise, Supabase, Qdrant, Open WebUI, etc.) you want to deploy. Core services (Caddy, Postgres, Redis) will be set up to support your selections.

Upon successful completion, the script will display a summary report. This report contains the access URLs and credentials for the deployed services. **Save this information in a safe place!**

### Notes for Arch Linux / CachyOS

The same `sudo bash ./scripts/install.sh` command works on Arch-based systems; the installer detects the package family from `/etc/os-release` and uses `pacman` instead of `apt`. Differences worth knowing:

- **Package names.** `build-essential` → `base-devel`, `whiptail` → `libnewt`, `python3-dotenv` / `python3-yaml` → `python-dotenv` / `python-yaml`. Docker, Compose, Buildx, Caddy, UFW and Fail2Ban all come from the official repositories — no third-party repo, AUR helper or Go toolchain is needed.
- **No automatic security updates.** Arch is a rolling release, so `unattended-upgrades` is not used. Run `make update` (which performs `pacman -Syu`) regularly.
- **Firewall.** UFW rules are persisted through `ufw.service`, which the installer enables.
- **Fail2Ban.** Arch ships fail2ban with no jail enabled, so the installer writes `/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/sshd.local` with `[sshd] enabled = true`. Your own `jail.local` / `jail.d/*.conf` files are never touched.
- **Sysbox (n8n Assistant sandbox).** There is no official Arch package, so the installer unpacks the upstream `.deb` payload with `ar` + `bsdtar` and registers `sysbox-runc` in `/etc/docker/daemon.json` with `--no-kernel-check` (Sysbox 0.7.1's kernel matrix predates current Arch kernels), then restarts Docker. If you already manage `daemon.json` yourself, review the added `runtimes` entry.
- **Kernel.** The n8n sandbox needs a kernel newer than 5.19, which every current Arch/CachyOS kernel satisfies. Sysbox needs `ext4` or `btrfs` under `/var/lib` and Docker's data root.

## Quick Start and Usage

After successful installation, your services are up and running! Here's how to get started:

1.  **Access Your Services:**
    The installation script provided a summary report with all access URLs and credentials. Please refer to that report. The main services will be available at the following addresses (replace `yourdomain.com` with your actual domain):

    - **n8n:** `n8n.yourdomain.com` (Log in with the email address you provided during installation and the initial password from the summary report. You may be prompted to change this password on first login.)
    - **n8n-MCP:** `n8n-mcp.yourdomain.com` (MCP endpoint at `/mcp`. Every request must send `Authorization: Bearer <N8N_MCP_AUTH_TOKEN>` - the token is on the Welcome Page - so a browser visit returns 401 by design. Connect with `npx -y mcp-remote https://n8n-mcp.yourdomain.com/mcp --header "Authorization: Bearer <token>"`, or keep the token out of your shell history and process list with `--header-file <path>` pointing at a file containing `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. Starts in documentation-only mode; to also manage workflows, create an API key in n8n under Settings -> n8n API, set `N8N_API_KEY` in `.env` and run `make restart`. Note that outside n8n Enterprise an API key has full account access. Optionally set `N8N_MCP_ACCESS_TOKEN` (n8n Settings -> Instance-level MCP -> Connect -> API key; n8n 2.34+) for the tools only n8n's own MCP server provides - see `.env.example`.)
    - **Appsmith:** `appsmith.yourdomain.com` (Low-code app builder)
    - **ComfyUI:** `comfyui.yourdomain.com` (Node-based Stable Diffusion UI; the wizard asks for NVIDIA, AMD or CPU. Models and custom nodes persist in the `comfyui_data` volume; on NVIDIA, reserve GPUs with `COMFYUI_GPU_COUNT` or pin them with `COMFYUI_GPU_DEVICES`)
    - **Databasus:** `databasus.yourdomain.com`
    - **Dify:** `dify.yourdomain.com` (AI application development platform with comprehensive LLMOps capabilities)
    - **Docling:** `docling.yourdomain.com` (Universal document converter with REST API; web UI available at `/ui`)
    - **Flowise:** `flowise.yourdomain.com` (Log in with the email address you provided during installation and the initial password from the summary report.)
    - **Grafana:** `grafana.yourdomain.com`
    - **InvokeAI:** `invokeai.yourdomain.com` (Stable Diffusion studio; download a model via the Model Manager on first visit)
    - **Langfuse:** `langfuse.yourdomain.com`
    - **Letta:** `letta.yourdomain.com`
    - **LibreTranslate:** `translate.yourdomain.com`
    - **LightRAG:** `lightrag.yourdomain.com`
    - **Neo4j:** `neo4j.yourdomain.com`
    - **NocoDB:** `nocodb.yourdomain.com`
    - **Ollama:** `ollama.yourdomain.com` (Optional local-LLM API; every request must send `Authorization: Bearer <OLLAMA_CADDY_API_TOKEN>`. A leaked token grants full control — including pulling/deleting models — not just inference.)
    - **Open WebUI:** `webui.yourdomain.com`
    - **PaddleOCR:** `paddleocr.yourdomain.com`
    - **Portainer:** `portainer.yourdomain.com` (Protected by Caddy basic auth; on first login, complete Portainer admin setup)
    - **Postiz:** `postiz.yourdomain.com`
    - **Prometheus:** `prometheus.yourdomain.com` (Typically used as a data source for Grafana)
    - **Qdrant:** `qdrant.yourdomain.com`
    - **RAGApp:** `ragapp.yourdomain.com`
    - **RAGFlow:** `ragflow.yourdomain.com`
    - **SearXNG:** `searxng.yourdomain.com`
    - **Supabase (Dashboard):** `supabase.yourdomain.com`
    - **Uptime Kuma:** `uptime-kuma.yourdomain.com` (Uptime monitoring dashboard)
    - **WAHA:** `waha.yourdomain.com` (WhatsApp HTTP API; engines: WEBJS, NOWEB, GOWS)
    - **Weaviate:** `weaviate.yourdomain.com`

### Optional Internal Utility: Python Runner

- **What it is**: An internal-only service to run your custom Python code inside the same Docker network as your other services (n8n, Postgres, Qdrant, etc.). No external ports are exposed, and it is not proxied by Caddy.
- **How to enable**: Select “Python Runner” in the Service Selection Wizard during install/update, or add the profile manually: `COMPOSE_PROFILES=...,python-runner`.
- **Where to put code**: Place your Python files in `python-runner/`. The default entry point is `python-runner/main.py`.
- **Dependencies**: Add them to `python-runner/requirements.txt`; they will be installed automatically on container start.

### Open Terminal: execution sandbox for Open WebUI agents

Open WebUI can search, read and reason, and its built-in code interpreter runs a snippet of Python, but out of the box it cannot keep files around, install a dependency or start a local service. [Open Terminal](https://docs.openwebui.com/features/open-terminal/) closes that loop: a Linux environment the chat drives, with a shell, a persistent home directory, apt/pip/npm installs at runtime, port proxying for local services and Jupyter kernels. Select **Open Terminal** in the wizard (`open-terminal` profile, requires `open-webui`). Nothing is published and there is no URL; Open WebUI talks to `open-terminal:8000` over the internal network.

- **Connect it once**: in Open WebUI open **Admin Settings → Integrations → Open Terminal** and add `http://open-terminal:8000` with the API key from the Welcome Page (`OPEN_TERMINAL_API_KEY` in `.env`). Add it there, not as a tool server, and not in your personal settings: the admin connection keeps the key on the server, a personal one sends it to the browser.
- **Access is deliberate**: a new connection is visible to admins only. Grant it to users or groups in the same dialog. Everyone you grant gets a shell inside the container (an unprivileged Linux account in multi-user mode, a sudo-capable one with `OPEN_TERMINAL_MULTI_USER=false`), which sits on the same Docker network as Postgres, Ollama, n8n and the rest, so treat it like giving out SSH access.
- **Multi-user by default**: `OPEN_TERMINAL_MULTI_USER=true` creates a Linux account per Open WebUI user with its own home under the `localai_open_terminal_home` volume. Files and processes are isolated, the network namespace is not: a local service one user starts on a port is reachable through another user's proxy URL. Set it to `false` for a single shared shell.
- **Size and limits**: the full image (`latest`, or a release tag such as `0.12.5` via `OPEN_TERMINAL_VERSION`) is about 4 GB and is the only variant that supports multi-user and runtime installs; the installer refuses a `slim`/`alpine`/`openshift` variant while multi-user is on. The container is capped at `OPEN_TERMINAL_CPU_LIMIT=2.0` CPUs and `OPEN_TERMINAL_MEMORY_LIMIT=2G`; raise them in `.env` if the agent needs more.
- **Preinstalled packages**: `OPEN_TERMINAL_PACKAGES`, `OPEN_TERMINAL_PIP_PACKAGES` and `OPEN_TERMINAL_NPM_PACKAGES` are reinstalled on every container start, so long lists slow startup. In multi-user mode they are the only way to add apt packages, because per-user accounts have no `sudo`; the agent can still `pip install --user` and use project-local npm. With multi-user off the shell has `sudo` and installs anything itself.
- **Egress filtering** (`OPEN_TERMINAL_ALLOWED_DOMAINS`) is not wired into the stack: the image treats an empty value as "block all outbound traffic" and needs `NET_ADMIN`. If you want it, add the variable together with `cap_add: [NET_ADMIN]` to the `open-terminal` service in `docker-compose.override.yml`.

2.  **Explore n8n:**

    - Log in to your n8n instance. This is your central hub for workflow automation.
    - If you chose to import the community workflows during installation, you'll find over 300 examples in your "Workflows" section. These are a great way to learn and get ideas.
    - Start building your first workflow! You have access to over 400 integrations and powerful AI tools.

3.  **Utilize Integrated AI Tools:**

    - **Connect n8n with Vector Stores:** Use n8n to connect to Qdrant (accessible via its own endpoint if needed, typically `qdrant.yourdomain.com`), Supabase, or Weaviate (`weaviate.yourdomain.com`) to store and retrieve information for your AI tasks like Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).
    - **Build with Flowise:** Access Flowise at `flowise.yourdomain.com` to create AI agents and applications. You can trigger Flowise agents from n8n or vice-versa.
    - **Interact with Open WebUI:** Use Open WebUI at `webui.yourdomain.com` as a chat interface for your local AI models or n8n agents (e.g., using the n8n_pipe integration if configured).
    - **Configure LLMs:** If you wish to use large language models (LLMs) from providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, or locally via Ollama (if installed), you can easily configure credentials and connections within n8n nodes or in services like Flowise and Open WebUI.

4.  **Check Monitoring (Optional):**
    - Visit Grafana (`grafana.yourdomain.com`) to see dashboards monitoring your system's performance (data sourced from Prometheus).
    - The **n8n Monitoring** dashboard includes a *Workflow Executions* section, and four alert rules are pre-provisioned: *n8n workflow failed* (non-manual executions only, so testing in the editor does not page), *n8n workflow stalled* (an active workflow with no success for 24 hours), *n8n workflow has no recorded success* (active for 24 hours without ever succeeding since monitoring started) and *n8n metrics target down*. The 24-hour thresholds are global, so workflows that run less than daily will alert; tune them in `grafana/provisioning/alerting/n8n-workflows.yml`. Alerts follow Grafana's default notification policy, whose built-in email contact point delivers nothing without SMTP: create a contact point (Telegram, Slack, Email with `GF_SMTP_*`, ...) under **Alerting → Contact points** and select it in **Alerting → Notification policies**.
	

## Secure Access with Cloudflare Tunnel (Optional)

Cloudflare Tunnel provides zero-trust access to your services without exposing any ports on your server. All traffic is routed through Cloudflare's secure network, providing DDoS protection and hiding your server's IP address.

### Benefits
- **No exposed ports** - Ports 80/443 can be completely closed
- **DDoS protection** - Built-in Cloudflare protection
- **IP hiding** - Your server's real IP is never exposed
- **Zero-trust security** - Optional Cloudflare Access integration
- **No public IP required** - Works on private networks

### Setup Instructions

See the Cloudflare Tunnel guide: [cloudflare-instructions.md](cloudflare-instructions.md)


### Using Libraries in n8n Code Nodes (v2.0+)

n8n v2.0 uses external task runners to execute JavaScript and Python code in Code nodes. This setup pre-configures the following libraries via `n8n/Dockerfile.runner` and `n8n/n8n-task-runners.json`:

**JavaScript libraries**:
- **`cheerio`**: For parsing and manipulating HTML/XML (e.g., web scraping).
- **`axios`**: A promise-based HTTP client for making requests to external APIs.
- **`moment`**: For parsing, validating, manipulating, and displaying dates/times.
- **`lodash`**: A utility library for common programming tasks (arrays, objects, strings, etc.).

### Pre-installed System Tools in n8n

The custom n8n Docker image (`n8n/Dockerfile.n8n`) includes the following system-level tools:

- **`ffmpeg`**: A powerful multimedia framework for converting, recording, and streaming audio and video. Use it via the [Execute Command](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executecommand/) node in n8n workflows for tasks like:
  - Converting video/audio formats (e.g., MP4 to MP3)
  - Extracting audio from video files
  - Resizing or compressing media files
  - Generating thumbnails from videos

### n8n Assistant sandbox (AI Assistant / Agents)

n8n's built-in AI Assistant and the Agents preview build, edit and debug workflows through conversation, and on a self-hosted instance they need a code-execution sandbox before they do anything (the Instance AI settings page shows `Code sandbox: Not set` until one exists). Select **n8n Assistant sandbox** in the wizard (`n8n-sandbox` profile, requires `n8n`) and the installer adds n8n's own sandbox stack next to n8n: a one-shot certificate job, the `sandbox-api` service and a Docker-in-Docker `sandbox-runner-1`. Nothing is published; n8n talks to `sandbox-api` over the internal network. Budget about 4 GB of extra RAM for it.

After installation, open n8n → **Settings → Instance AI** and add a model API key (Anthropic, OpenAI, OpenRouter or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint). The sandbox and, when the `searxng` profile is active, web search through the bundled SearXNG are already wired in. n8n's docs position this bundled sandbox as the self-hosted option and Daytona as the hosted one; the Agents knowledge base is the only feature that needs Daytona.

**How the runner is isolated.** Docker-in-Docker normally requires a `privileged` container, which is root-equivalent on the host. The installer avoids that by installing [Sysbox](https://github.com/nestybox/sysbox) (`scripts/setup_sysbox.sh`) and running the runner with `runtime: sysbox-runc`. This installer supports Sysbox on Ubuntu 20.04/22.04/24.04 or Debian 11 (amd64/arm64) and, following n8n's sandbox service, requires a kernel newer than 5.19, Docker installed natively (Sysbox does not support the snap), `/var/lib` and Docker's data root on ext4 or btrfs, and a VM or bare-metal host (not an LXC or other system container). The installer also loads the `br_netfilter` module (the sandbox network policy needs it in both isolation modes) and, before installing Sysbox, adds `bip` and `default-address-pools` entries to `/etc/docker/daemon.json` that mirror Docker's current values: the Sysbox package needs them present to install without rewriting Docker's networking or restarting Docker, so running services are not interrupted. If a prerequisite is missing, or your Docker network setup is custom (`-b`/`--bridge`, `--bip`, `--fixed-cidr` or `--default-address-pool` flags; `bridge`, `fixed-cidr`, `fixed-cidr-v6` or `ipv6: true` in `daemon.json`; no `docker0` bridge), the installer asks whether to run the runner **privileged** instead; say No and the profile is dropped. The choice is recorded in `.env` as `N8N_SANDBOX_RUNNER_RUNTIME` / `N8N_SANDBOX_RUNNER_PRIVILEGED`, `make doctor` warns while the runner is privileged, and `make update` retries Sysbox. On a host you configured yourself, install the `sysbox-ce` package by hand ([release 0.7.1](https://github.com/nestybox/sysbox/releases/tag/v0.7.1); its installer registers the runtime, but refuses to run while containers exist unless `daemon.json` already has `bip` and `default-address-pools`, so do it with the stack stopped) and run `make update`.

Notes:

- **Agents preview**: set `N8N_ENABLED_MODULES=instance-ai,agents` in `.env` and `make restart`. Leave it empty otherwise; an unknown module name stops n8n from booting. The Agents knowledge base additionally needs a Daytona sandbox, which this stack does not provide.
- **Versions**: the three sandbox images are released together and follow `:latest`; set `N8N_SANDBOX_VERSION` in `.env` to pin one release for all of them. The runner downloads the sandbox image (about 330 MB) on first use after each `make update` or `make restart`, so the first assistant request after that takes a little longer.
- **Certificates** between `sandbox-api` and the runner are generated once into the `localai_n8n_sandbox_tls` volume and do not renew themselves. To regenerate: `docker compose -p localai rm -sf sandbox-certs sandbox-api sandbox-runner-1`, then `docker volume rm localai_n8n_sandbox_tls`, then `make restart`.
- **Removing Sysbox**: `sudo apt-get purge sysbox-ce && sudo userdel sysbox`; the two `daemon.json` entries and `/etc/modules-load.d/n8n-sandbox.conf` (br_netfilter autoload) are harmless and can stay.

## Upgrading

To update all components (n8n, Open WebUI, etc.) to their latest versions and incorporate the newest changes from this installer project:

```bash
make update
```

**For forks**: If you maintain a fork with custom changes and want to merge updates from upstream instead of resetting:

```bash
make git-pull
```

This script will:

1.  Fetch the latest updates for the installer from the Git repository.
2.  Temporarily stop the currently running services.
3.  Download the latest versions of the Docker images for all services.
4.  Ask if you want to re-run the n8n workflow import (useful if you skipped this during the initial installation or want to refresh the community workflows).
5.  Restart all services with the new updates.

### Custom Configuration That Survives Updates

`make update` resets tracked files (like `Caddyfile` and `docker-compose.yml`) to the latest version, so never edit them directly. Instead, use the dedicated extension points — the files you create there are gitignored, so they are preserved across updates:

- **Custom Caddy entries** (e.g. reverse proxy for a service running outside this stack): drop a `site-*.conf` file into `caddy-addon/`. It is imported automatically by the main Caddyfile. See [caddy-addon/README.md](caddy-addon/README.md) for examples.
- **Docker Compose overrides** (change any service property): create a `docker-compose.override.yml` in the project root. It is picked up automatically with the highest precedence.
- **Settings**: values you set in `.env` are preserved by the updater (except `GOST_NO_PROXY`, which is regenerated so it always covers newly added services).

### Ollama on multi-GPU hosts

By default the stack runs a single Ollama container. On a machine with several GPUs you can run more, so a large model can stay resident on its own GPU instead of being swapped out whenever another model is used.

Set `OLLAMA_INSTANCE_COUNT` in `.env` (1-8) and run `make update` (or `bash scripts/generate_ollama_instances.sh` followed by `make restart`). Instance 1 stays the familiar `ollama` container; extras are `ollama2`, `ollama3`, and so on.

```env
OLLAMA_INSTANCE_COUNT=3
OLLAMA_GPU_DEVICES=0,1     # instance 1 -> GPUs 0 and 1
OLLAMA2_GPU_DEVICES=2      # instance 2 -> GPU 2
OLLAMA3_GPU_DEVICES=3      # instance 3 -> GPU 3

OLLAMA2_KEEP_ALIVE=-1      # keep this instance's model resident forever
OLLAMA3_MAX_LOADED_MODELS=1
```

The runtime tuning variables — `KEEP_ALIVE`, `NUM_PARALLEL`, `MAX_LOADED_MODELS`, `CONTEXT_LENGTH`, `KV_CACHE_TYPE`, `GPU_OVERHEAD`, `SCHED_SPREAD` — can be set per instance with an `OLLAMA<N>_` prefix, and an unset one falls back to the global value. These take effect on the next `make restart`, with no regeneration needed. (`OLLAMA_GPU_COUNT` has no per-instance form, and `OLLAMA<N>_GPU_DEVICES` does not fall back to the global `OLLAMA_GPU_DEVICES` — it defaults to GPU N-1.)

Anything beyond those knobs — llama.cpp `LLAMA_ARG_*` variables, ROCm `HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION`, and so on — goes into optional env files next to `.env`: `ollama.env` applies to every instance, `ollama<N>.env` to one instance and overrides `ollama.env`. A typical use is a smaller free-VRAM margin on a GPU that serves nothing but one Ollama instance:

```env
# ollama2.env - this GPU serves only ollama2, so leave less VRAM unused
LLAMA_ARG_FIT_TARGET=128
```

The files are gitignored and applied on the next `make restart`. Only llama-server-backed models read `LLAMA_ARG_*`; models running on Ollama's own engine ignore them. Keep the `OLLAMA_*` knobs listed above in `.env` — those values win over the files; any other `OLLAMA_*` variable belongs in the files.

Notes:

- **On NVIDIA, set `OLLAMA_GPU_DEVICES` too.** Extra instances are pinned to explicit GPU IDs, but instance 1 falls back to a count-based reservation and may otherwise land on a GPU already assigned to `ollama2`. `make doctor` warns about this. On AMD, `OLLAMA_GPU_DEVICES` is ignored: extra instances are pinned with `HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES`, while instance 1 still sees every GPU — pin it yourself in `docker-compose.override.yml` if that matters.
- **All instances share one model store**, so each model is downloaded only once.
- **Extra instances are internal only**, reachable at `http://ollama2:11434` from other containers — for example, add it as a second connection in Open WebUI. There are no published ports; if you need external access to a specific instance, add a `caddy-addon/site-*.conf` file.
- Lowering the count stops and removes the surplus containers on the next `make update`.

### Open WebUI: SQLite or PostgreSQL

Open WebUI stores chats, users and settings in either SQLite (a single file in the `open-webui` volume) or the stack's shared PostgreSQL. SQLite allows only one writer at a time, so with several tabs or devices open you may see:

```
sqlalchemy.exc.OperationalError: (sqlite3.OperationalError) database is locked
```

PostgreSQL handles concurrent writes and puts the data in the same backup as the rest of the stack. Which one you get is controlled by `OPEN_WEBUI_DATABASE` in `.env`:

- **New installations** default to `postgres`.
- **Existing installations** stay on `sqlite`, deliberately. **Open WebUI does not migrate data between databases** — switching would give you an empty Open WebUI while your chats, users and tags stayed in `webui.db`.

To switch an existing installation:

1. **Back up the volume first** (check the exact name with `docker volume ls | grep open-webui`):
   ```bash
   docker run --rm -v localai_open-webui:/data -v "$PWD":/backup alpine \
     tar czf /backup/open-webui-backup.tar.gz -C /data .
   ```
2. Set `OPEN_WEBUI_DATABASE=postgres` in `.env`.
3. Run `make update` (not just `make restart`) — the `openwebui` database is created by `make install`/`make update`, and pointing Open WebUI at a database that does not exist gives you a container that starts and then fails every request.
4. Open WebUI comes up **empty**. If you want your old data, migrate it now, **before registering an account** — importing users into a schema that already has an admin can collide on the primary key or the unique email. Use a purpose-built tool: [open-webui-postgres-migration](https://github.com/taylorwilsdon/open-webui-postgres-migration) or [Open-WebUI-SQLite-migration](https://github.com/Digitalist-Open-Cloud/Open-WebUI-SQLite-migration). Prefer these over generic `pgloader`, which does not understand Open WebUI's JSON and blob columns.
5. Log in with your migrated account. Only register a fresh admin if you deliberately want to start empty.

To revert, set `OPEN_WEBUI_DATABASE=sqlite` and run `make restart` — the original SQLite file is left untouched.

Note that uploaded files and the vector store live in the `open-webui` volume in **either** mode, so moving the database does not make Open WebUI stateless and does not put all of its data into your PostgreSQL backup.

## Security Notes

### Published host ports bypass the firewall

The installer configures `ufw` with `default deny incoming`, but **that does not cover Docker.** Docker publishes container ports in the `nat` table, which is evaluated *before* the `INPUT` chain `ufw` uses — so any port a container publishes on `0.0.0.0` is reachable from the internet regardless of your firewall rules. See [Docker: packet filtering and firewalls](https://docs.docker.com/engine/network/packet-filtering-firewalls/).

By design this stack publishes almost nothing: every service is reached through Caddy on ports 80/443 only. To audit what is actually exposed on your server:

```bash
docker ps --format '{{.Names}}\t{{.Ports}}'   # the reliable check
ss -ltnp                                      # host listeners
```

Trust `docker ps` here: with `"userland-proxy": false` the listener is owned by `dockerd` rather than a `docker-proxy` process, so `ss` output is easy to misread even though the port is published.

Anything showing `0.0.0.0:<port>->` is internet-reachable if your server has a public IP.

- **Supabase API gateway** — bound to `127.0.0.1:8000` by default. Caddy still reaches it over the Docker network, and host-local tooling (`curl http://localhost:8000`) keeps working. To expose it deliberately, set `API_GW_HTTP_PORT` in `.env` (e.g. `API_GW_HTTP_PORT=8000` for all interfaces, or `API_GW_HTTP_PORT=192.168.1.10:8000` for one LAN address) and run `make restart`. `make doctor` warns if the gateway is bound to all interfaces.
- **Supabase database and pooler** — Supabase's upstream compose still publishes `0.0.0.0:5432` and `0.0.0.0:6543` from its `supavisor` service (container `supabase-pooler`). **If you run the `supabase` profile on a public-IP server, restrict these at your cloud provider's firewall or security group**, which is enforced outside the host and therefore not bypassed by Docker. You can close the pooler port yourself by setting `POOLER_PROXY_PORT_TRANSACTION=127.0.0.1:6543` in **`supabase/docker/.env`** — that is the file Compose interpolates for the Supabase stack, and the variable is only used for the port mapping. Editing the root `.env` has no effect here: the installer copies it to `supabase/docker/.env` once and afterwards only appends keys that are *missing* there, and only `API_GW_HTTP_PORT`/`KONG_HTTP_PORT`/`KONG_HTTPS_PORT` are force-synced. Re-apply your edit after any upstream change that recreates that file. The `5432` mapping cannot be handled the same way: `POSTGRES_PORT` is reused as a bare numeric port throughout Supabase's own connection strings, so it cannot take an address prefix.

## Cleaning up Docker

If you need to free up disk space, you can run the Docker cleanup command. This removes all unused Docker containers, images, and volumes.

```bash
make clean
```

This can be useful for removing old images and freeing up space, but be aware that it will remove all unused data.

## Troubleshooting

Here are solutions to common issues you might encounter:

### Sites not loading even after following the instructions

- **Symptom:** Your domains/sites do not open or return errors even though you completed all installation steps.
- **Likely cause:** Your VPS does not have enough resources for the set of services you selected.
- **What to try:**
  1. Check current CPU and RAM usage (e.g., with `top`/`htop`, `free -h`, and `docker stats`). If resources are saturated, upgrade the server or reduce the number of running services.
  2. Try a minimal configuration — start only `n8n` and verify it comes up. If it works in this minimal setup, enable other services gradually while monitoring the load.

### Temporary "Dangerous Site" Warning in Browser

- **Symptom:** Immediately after deploying the services, your browser (e.g., Chrome) might display a "Dangerous Site" or similar security warning when you try to access your services. This warning typically disappears after some time (e.g., within a few hours or by the next day).
- **Cause:** This can happen for a couple of reasons:
  1.  **Brief use of a self-signed certificate:** When Caddy (the web server managing your SSL certificates) starts up for a new domain, it might briefly use a temporary, self-signed certificate while it's in the process of requesting and obtaining a valid SSL certificate from Let's Encrypt.
  2.  **Delay in applying the new certificate:** There might also be a short delay before the newly obtained certificate from Let's Encrypt is fully applied and recognized by all systems.
- **Solution:** This is usually a temporary issue and resolves itself. Give it some time. If the warning persists for more than 24 hours, check your Caddy logs for any errors related to certificate acquisition and ensure your DNS settings are correctly pointing your domain to the server's IP address. You can also try clearing your browser's cache or using an incognito/private window to re-check.

### General Issues

- **VPN Conflicts:** Using a VPN might interfere with downloading Docker images. If you encounter issues pulling images, try temporarily disabling your VPN.
- **Server Requirements:** If you experience unexpected issues, ensure your server meets the minimum hardware and operating system requirements (including version) as specified in the "Prerequisites before Installation" section.

### Update Script Not Working

- **Symptom:** The `make update` command fails, shows errors, or doesn't apply the latest changes.
- **Cause:** This can happen if your local repository has diverged from the upstream, has uncommitted changes, or is in an inconsistent state.
- **Solution:** Run the following command to force-sync your local installation with the latest version:

  ```bash
  git config pull.rebase true && git fetch origin && git checkout main && git reset --hard "origin/main" && make update
  ```

  **Warning:** This will discard any local changes you've made to the installer files. If you've customized any scripts or configurations, back them up first.

## Tips & Tricks

### Accessing Files on the Server

The installer creates a `shared` folder (by default, located in the same directory where you ran the installation script). This folder is accessible by the n8n application.
When you build automations in n8n that need to read or write files on your server, use the path `/data/shared` inside your n8n workflows. This path in n8n points to the `shared` folder on your server.
