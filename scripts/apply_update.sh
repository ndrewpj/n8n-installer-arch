# apply_update.sh - Service update and restart logic
# =============================================================================
# Called by update.sh after git sync. Performs the actual service updates:
#   1. Updates .env with any new variables (03_generate_secrets.sh --update)
#   2. Runs service selection wizard (04_wizard.sh) to update profiles
#   3. Configures services (05_configure_services.sh)
#   4. Pulls latest Docker images for selected services
#   5. Restarts all services (06_run_services.sh)
#   6. Displays final report (07_final_report.sh)
#
# Handles multiple compose files: main, n8n-workers, Supabase, and Dify.
#
# Usage: Called automatically by update.sh (not typically run directly)
