# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is **Selfhost AI** (repository `selfhost-ai`, formerly `n8n-install`), a Docker Compose-based installer that provides a comprehensive self-hosted environment for n8n workflow automation and numerous AI/automation services. The installer includes an interactive wizard, automated secret generation, and integrated HTTPS via Caddy.

### Core Architecture

- **Profile-based service management**: Services are activated via Docker Compose profiles (e.g., `n8n`, `flowise`, `monitoring`). Profiles are stored in the `.env` file's `COMPOSE_PROFILES` variable.
- **No exposed ports**: Services do NOT publish ports directly. All external HTTPS access is routed through Caddy reverse proxy on ports 80/443.
- **Shared secrets**: Core services (Postgres, Valkey (Redis-compatible, container named `redis` for backward compatibility), Caddy) are always included. Other services are optional and selected during installation.
- **Queue-based n8n**: n8n runs in `queue` mode with Redis, Postgres, and dynamically scaled workers (`N8N_WORKER_COUNT`).

### Key Files

- `scripts/setup_sysbox.sh`: Installs Sysbox (`sysbox-runc`) for the n8n Assistant sandbox runner; called by `05_configure_services.sh` when the `n8n-sandbox` profile is active
- `start_services.py`: Python orchestrator for service startup order, builds Docker images, handles external services (Supabase/Dify cloning, env preparation, startup), generates SearXNG secret key, stops existing containers. Uses `python-dotenv` (`dotenv_values`).

**Project Name**: All docker-compose commands use `-p localai` (defined in Makefile as `PROJECT_NAME := localai`).

**Version**: Stored in `VERSION` file at repository root.

### Installation Flow

`scripts/install.sh` orchestrates the installation by running numbered scripts in sequence:

1. `01_system_preparation.sh` - System updates, firewall, security hardening
2. `02_install_docker.sh` - Docker and Docker Compose installation
3. `03_generate_secrets.sh` - Generate passwords, API keys, bcrypt hashes
4. `04_wizard.sh` - Interactive service selection (whiptail UI)
5. `05_configure_services.sh` - Service-specific configuration
6. `06_run_services.sh` - Start Docker Compose stack
7. `07_final_report.sh` - Display credentials and URLs
8. `08_fix_permissions.sh` - Fix file ownership for non-root access

The update flow (`scripts/update.sh`) similarly orchestrates: git fetch + reset → service selection → `apply_update.sh` → restart. During updates, `03_generate_secrets.sh` adds new variables from `.env.example` without regenerating existing ones (preserves user-set values). Note the `--update` flag `apply_update.sh` passes is **not parsed** - the behavior is unconditional, and code that needs to tell a fresh install from an upgrade tests `${#existing_env_vars[@]} -gt 0` instead (see the `DB_MIGRATION_VARS` and `OPEN_WEBUI_DATABASE` blocks).

**Git update modes**: Default is `reset` (hard reset to origin). Set `GIT_MODE=merge` in `.env` for fork workflows (merges from upstream instead of hard reset). The `make git-pull` command uses merge mode. Git branch support is explicit: `GIT_SUPPORTED_BRANCHES=("main" "develop")` in `git.sh`; unknown branches warn and fall back to `main`.

## Common Development Commands

### Makefile Commands

```bash
make install           # Full installation (runs scripts/install.sh)
make update            # Update system and services (resets to origin)
make update-preview    # Preview available updates (dry-run)
make git-pull          # Update for forks (merges from upstream/main)
make clean             # Remove unused Docker resources (preserves data)
make clean-all         # Remove ALL Docker resources including data (DANGEROUS)

make logs              # View logs (all services)
make logs s=<service>  # View logs for specific service
make status            # Show container status
make monitor           # Live CPU/memory monitoring (docker stats)
make restart           # Restart all services
make stop              # Stop all services
make start             # Start all services
make show-restarts     # Show restart count per container
make doctor            # Run system diagnostics (DNS, SSL, containers, disk, memory)
make import            # Import n8n workflows from backup
make import n=10       # Import first N workflows only
make setup-tls         # Configure custom TLS certificates

make switch-beta       # Switch to develop branch and update
make switch-stable     # Switch to main branch and update
make help              # Show all available commands
```


## Adding a New Service

Follow this workflow when adding a new optional service (refer to `.claude/commands/add-new-service.md` for complete details):

1. **docker-compose.yml**: Add service with `profiles: ["myservice"]`, `restart: unless-stopped`. Do NOT expose ports.
2. **Caddyfile**: Add reverse proxy block using `{$MYSERVICE_HOSTNAME}`. Consider if basic auth is needed.
3. **.env.example**: Add `MYSERVICE_HOSTNAME=myservice.yourdomain.com` and credentials if using basic auth.
4. **scripts/03_generate_secrets.sh**: Generate passwords and bcrypt hashes. Add to `VARS_TO_GENERATE` map.
5. **scripts/04_wizard.sh**: Add service to `base_services_data` array for wizard selection.
6. **scripts/databases.sh**: If service uses PostgreSQL, add database name to `INIT_DB_DATABASES` array. Database creation is idempotent (checks existence before creating). Note: Postiz also requires `temporal` and `temporal_visibility` databases.
7. **scripts/generate_welcome_page.sh**: Add service to `SERVICES_ARRAY` for welcome dashboard.
8. **welcome/app.js**: Add `SERVICE_METADATA` entry with name, description, icon, color, category.
9. **scripts/07_final_report.sh**: Add service URL and credentials output using `is_profile_active "myservice"`.
10. **README.md**: Add one-line description under "What's Included".
11. **CHANGELOG.md**: Add entry under `## [Unreleased]` → `### Added` (new service = minor version bump).

**Always ask users if the new service requires Caddy basic auth protection.**

## Important Service Details

### n8n Configuration (v2.0+)

- n8n runs in `EXECUTIONS_MODE=queue` with Redis as the queue backend
- **OFFLOAD_MANUAL_EXECUTIONS_TO_WORKERS=true**: All executions (including manual tests) run on workers
- **Worker-Runner Sidecar Pattern**: Each worker has its own dedicated task runner
  - Workers and runners are generated dynamically via `scripts/generate_n8n_workers.sh`
  - Configuration stored in `docker-compose.n8n-workers.yml` (auto-generated, gitignored)
  - Runner connects to its worker via `network_mode: "service:n8n-worker-N"` (localhost:5679)
  - Runner image `n8nio/runners` must match n8n version
- **Template profile pattern**: `docker-compose.yml` defines `n8n-worker-template` and `n8n-runner-template` with `profiles: ["n8n-template"]` (never activated directly). `generate_n8n_workers.sh` uses these as templates to generate `docker-compose.n8n-workers.yml` with the actual worker/runner services.
- **Scaling**: Change `N8N_WORKER_COUNT` in `.env` and run `bash scripts/generate_n8n_workers.sh`
- **Code node libraries**: Configured via `n8n/n8n-task-runners.json` and `n8n/Dockerfile.runner`:
  - **JavaScript runner**: packages installed via `pnpm add` in Dockerfile.runner; allowlist in `n8n-task-runners.json` (`NODE_FUNCTION_ALLOW_EXTERNAL`, `NODE_FUNCTION_ALLOW_BUILTIN`); default packages: `cheerio`, `axios`, `moment`, `lodash`
  - **Python runner**: also configured in `n8n-task-runners.json`; uses `/opt/runners/task-runner-python/.venv/bin/python` with `N8N_RUNNERS_STDLIB_ALLOW: "*"` and `N8N_RUNNERS_EXTERNAL_ALLOW: "*"`
- Workflows can access the host filesystem via `/data/shared` (mapped to `./shared`)
- `N8N_BLOCK_ENV_ACCESS_IN_NODE=false` allows Code nodes to access environment variables

### Ollama Multi-Instance (multi-GPU)

- `OLLAMA_INSTANCE_COUNT` in `.env` (default 1, max 8) drives `scripts/generate_ollama_instances.sh`, which writes `docker-compose.ollama-instances.yml` (auto-generated, gitignored)
- **Template profile pattern**, same as the n8n workers: `docker-compose.yml` defines `ollama-instance-template` and `ollama-instance-template-amd` with `profiles: ["ollama-template"]` (never activated directly)
- **The templates deliberately carry no `deploy:` block.** Compose *appends* `deploy.resources.reservations.devices` across `extends`, so a count-based reservation on the template would leak an extra, arbitrary GPU into every instance that pins specific device IDs. Do not add one.
- Instance 1 is the stock `ollama` container and is never modified; count 1 generates nothing and **removes** a stale file, which otherwise resurrects the old instance set after a downscale
- Per-instance tuning uses `OLLAMA<N>_*` variables emitted as nested defaults (`${OLLAMA2_KEEP_ALIVE:-${OLLAMA_KEEP_ALIVE:-}}`), so users tune `.env` and restart without regenerating
- Anything else (llama.cpp `LLAMA_ARG_*`, ROCm vars) comes from optional, gitignored env files: `ollama.env` on the `x-ollama` anchor (inherited by every instance via `extends`) and `ollama<N>.env` emitted per instance, both `required: false`. **Never map such variables through `environment:` with `${VAR:-}`** - an empty `LLAMA_ARG_FIT_TARGET` makes llama-server exit at startup (`std::stoull("")`), and `environment:` keys override the files
- NVIDIA pins via `deploy.…device_ids`; AMD pins via `HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES`/`ROCR_VISIBLE_DEVICES` (ROCm passes all devices through)
- All instances share the `ollama_storage` volume, so models are downloaded once; only instance 1 has a model-pull job
- No published ports and no Caddy block for extra instances - they are internal (`ollama2:11434`); `caddy-addon/site-*.conf` is the documented extension point
- The generator is invoked unconditionally from `05_configure_services.sh`, which covers install and `make update`, and self-heals a stale file after a hardware-profile switch

### n8n Assistant sandbox (`n8n-sandbox` profile)

- Upstream n8n-sandbox-service as three services in `docker-compose.yml`: one-shot `sandbox-certs` (mTLS bootstrap into the `n8n_sandbox_tls` volume, skips when certs exist), `sandbox-api` (HTTP 8080 + gRPC 9090) and the Docker-in-Docker `sandbox-runner-1`. No ports, no Caddy block; n8n reaches `sandbox-api` by service name. **The cert SANs are the service names `sandbox-api` / `sandbox-runner-1` - do not rename them.** Exactly one runner by design.
- All three images share `N8N_SANDBOX_VERSION` (default `latest`, like most images here). The runner pulls the sandbox image into its inner Docker on first use, and deliberately has **no volume** for that inner Docker: a persisted cache would keep an old sandbox image while `make update` moves api and runner forward. The cost is one ~330 MB pull after every recreate.
- Three secrets, each referenced on both sides from one `.env` var: `N8N_SANDBOX_API_KEY` (n8n's `N8N_SANDBOX_SERVICE_API_KEY` = api's `SANDBOX_API_KEYS`), `N8N_SANDBOX_RUNNER_REGISTRATION_TOKEN`, `N8N_SANDBOX_RUNNER_API_KEY`.
- The n8n env anchor carries `N8N_INSTANCE_AI_SANDBOX_ENABLED` (written `true`/`false` by `05_configure_services.sh` from the profile), the sandbox URL/key, `N8N_INSTANCE_AI_SEARXNG_URL` (set to `http://searxng:8080` while `searxng` is active, cleared otherwise; a custom value is left alone) and `N8N_ENABLED_MODULES` (**empty by default** - `instance-ai` is default-on in n8n, and an unknown module name stops n8n from booting, so never default it to a name). There is deliberately no `depends_on` from `n8n` to `sandbox-api`: a dependency on a profile-gated service breaks compose when the profile is off. The model/API key is configured in the n8n UI, not in compose.
- Runner isolation: `runtime: "${N8N_SANDBOX_RUNNER_RUNTIME:-runc}"` + `privileged: "${N8N_SANDBOX_RUNNER_PRIVILEGED:-false}"` (compose casts the interpolated string to boolean). `05_configure_services.sh` runs `setup_sysbox.sh`; on success it writes `sysbox-runc`/`false`, otherwise it asks (`wt_yesno`, default No) before writing `runc`/`true`, and drops the profile on No. It also loads `br_netfilter` in both modes (the sandbox egress policy needs it) and persists it in `/etc/modules-load.d/n8n-sandbox.conf`. Without root, 05 exits 1 for this profile instead of configuring a runner that cannot start.
- `setup_sysbox.sh` must stay non-interactive. **On Debian/Ubuntu it must not restart Docker**: the `sysbox-ce` package refuses to install while any container exists unless `/etc/docker/daemon.json` already has pretty-printed `bip` and `default-address-pools` keys, so the script pre-seeds them with Docker's current values via `jq --indent 4` and then the package only registers the runtime and SIGHUPs dockerd. Hosts with a custom Docker network setup (`-b`/`--bridge`/`--bip`/`--default-address-pool`/`--fixed-cidr` flags; `bridge`, `fixed-cidr`, `fixed-cidr-v6` or `ipv6: true` in daemon.json; no `docker0`) are rejected instead of guessed at. An already installed Sysbox is re-tested with a container on every run, never trusted from `dpkg` state alone. `jq` is not installed by 01/02 - only this script may rely on it, after its own apt step.
- **On Arch/CachyOS the Sysbox install differs by design** (`PKG_FAMILY=arch` branch): there is no distro package and no official `.deb`-equivalent, so the script unpacks the upstream `.deb` payload with `ar` + `bsdtar` (both in every Arch base install) and installs the binaries, the three systemd units and `99-sysbox-sysctl.conf` by hand - no AUR helper and no Go toolchain. Runtime deps come from `pkg_install rsync fuse2`. Docker **is** restarted on this path (runtimes are not SIGHUP-reloadable) and `sysbox-runc` is registered in `daemon.json` with `runtimeArgs: ["--no-kernel-check"]`, because Sysbox 0.7.1's kernel matrix predates current Arch kernels. `sysbox_installed()` therefore checks for the binaries and the unit files, not `dpkg` state.
- **Distro detection lives in `utils.sh`**: `detect_distro()` sets `PKG_FAMILY` (`debian` / `arch` / `unknown`) and `DISTRO_ID` from `/etc/os-release` (`ID` + `ID_LIKE`), and `pkg_install` / `pkg_remove` / `pkg_is_installed` wrap the package manager. **Never detect the distro by probing for `apt-get`** - the `apt` package can be installed on an Arch system and yields a false positive. Scripts that touch the host package manager call `detect_distro` first (the `pkg_*` helpers also detect lazily).
- `make doctor` errors when `.env` says `sysbox-runc` but Docker lacks the runtime, and warns while the runner is privileged.

### Open Terminal (`open-terminal` profile)

- Single service `open-terminal` (`ghcr.io/open-webui/open-terminal`, tag from `OPEN_TERMINAL_VERSION`, default `latest`; only the full image - `latest` or a release tag like `0.12.5` - supports multi-user and runtime installs, the `*-slim`/`*-alpine`/`openshift` variants do not). No ports, no Caddy block; Open WebUI reaches `http://open-terminal:8000`. The wizard drops the profile when `open-webui` is not selected, same pattern as `n8n-sandbox` / `n8n`.
- **The connection is configured only in the Open WebUI Admin UI** (Admin Settings → Integrations → Open Terminal, URL + `OPEN_TERMINAL_API_KEY`). Do not pre-seed it via `TERMINAL_SERVER_CONNECTIONS`: Open WebUI seeds that key into its DB only when the key is missing, i.e. on a brand-new database, and a connection without `config.access_grants` is admin-only anyway. Open WebUI proxies every request server-side and sends `X-User-Id`, which multi-user mode maps to a Linux account under `/home` - the volume must be `/home`, not `/home/user`.
- **Never add `OPEN_TERMINAL_ALLOWED_DOMAINS` to the compose file.** The entrypoint distinguishes unset (full egress) from set-but-empty (drop all outbound) and runs `sudo iptables` under `set -e`, which needs `NET_ADMIN`; an interpolated `${VAR:-}` would crash the container. Egress filtering is a `docker-compose.override.yml` job together with `cap_add: [NET_ADMIN]`.
- Never mount `docker.sock`: the entrypoint auto-joins the socket's group and the agent's shell would control the host daemon. The server process runs as `user` with passwordless sudo, so no `cap_drop` (apt, useradd and sudo need CHOWN/SETUID/SETGID/DAC_OVERRIDE). Provisioned per-user accounts are plain `useradd` users **without sudo**; only `OPEN_TERMINAL_MULTI_USER=false` gives the chat the sudo-capable shell, and only then are the startup package lists optional. The boundary is the network and the Open WebUI access grants. Healthcheck uses `curl` against the unauthenticated `/docs`.
- `05_configure_services.sh` refuses a `slim`/`alpine`/`openshift` variant tag (bare or `-suffixed`) while `OPEN_TERMINAL_MULTI_USER=true`: those entrypoints ignore the multi-user and package variables, so every user would silently share one shell.

### Monitoring (Prometheus + Grafana)

- n8n metrics are enabled in the `x-n8n` anchor: `N8N_METRICS` plus `N8N_METRICS_INCLUDE_MESSAGE_EVENT_BUS_METRICS` / `_WORKFLOW_ID_LABEL` / `_WORKFLOW_NAME_LABEL` / `_WORKFLOW_INFO`. They expose `n8n_workflow_{started,success,failed,cancelled}_total{workflow_id,workflow_name}` and the `n8n_workflow_info` / `n8n_active_workflow_info` id-to-name gauges (leader main only). The alerts and recording rules also use `n8n_workflow_execution_duration_seconds{status,mode,workflow_id}`, which is on by default (`N8N_METRICS_INCLUDE_WORKFLOW_EXECUTION_DURATION`); turning it off silently disables them. Setting `N8N_METRICS_PREFIX` would break every panel and alert
- **In queue mode the workflow counters and the duration histogram are emitted by `n8n` main**, which finalises every top-level execution; workers only report sub-workflow executions, node events and their own process metrics. Panels and rules therefore aggregate across instances (`sum by (...)`) and must not filter on `$instance`
- Scrape targets are not static: `generate_n8n_workers.sh` writes `prometheus/targets/n8n.json` (gitignored) with the `n8n:5678` main target and one `n8n-worker-N:5678` per worker, each group carrying its `job` label, and `prometheus.yml` reads it via `file_sd_configs`. The generator runs unconditionally from `05_configure_services.sh` and removes the file when the n8n profile is inactive, so a monitoring-only install has no n8n targets and no permanently-down alert. Metrics are served on the queue-health port (`QUEUE_HEALTH_CHECK_PORT`, default 5678; 5679 is the task broker)
- `prometheus/rules/*.yml` holds recording rules keyed on `workflow_id` (`n8n:workflow_success:increase5m`, `n8n:workflow_last_success_timestamp_seconds`); names are joined at query time from `n8n_active_workflow_info`, so renames are followed. The whole `prometheus/` directory is bind-mounted read-only to `/etc/prometheus`
- Grafana's datasource, dashboards and alert rules are file-provisioned from `grafana/provisioning/`; contact points and notification policies are not, and no SMTP is configured. The Prometheus datasource has the fixed `uid: Prometheus` that dashboards and alert rules reference - keep them in sync. Grafana cannot change the uid of an existing datasource, so `main.yml` deletes it by name (`deleteDatasources`) and recreates it on every start; pre-1.10.0 installations had a random uid and crash-looped without this. Use `$__rate_interval`, never a fixed range window, in range queries
- No Alertmanager: alert rules are Grafana-managed (`grafana/provisioning/alerting/n8n-workflows.yml`); a malformed file stops Grafana from starting. `make doctor` checks that Grafana/Prometheus run, that the targets file matches `N8N_WORKER_COUNT` and that Prometheus loaded the `n8n-workflows` rule group without errors

### Caddy Reverse Proxy

- Automatically obtains Let's Encrypt certificates when `LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL` is set
- Hostnames are passed via environment variables (e.g., `N8N_HOSTNAME`, `FLOWISE_HOSTNAME`)
- Basic auth uses bcrypt hashes generated by `scripts/03_generate_secrets.sh` via Caddy's hash command
- Never add `ports:` to services in docker-compose.yml; let Caddy handle all external access
- **Caddy Addons** (`caddy-addon/`): Extend Caddy config without modifying the main Caddyfile. Files matching `site-*.conf` are auto-imported (gitignored, user-created). TLS is controlled via `tls-snippet.conf` (all service blocks use `import service_tls`). See `caddy-addon/README.md` for details.
- Custom TLS certificates go in `certs/` directory (gitignored), referenced as `/etc/caddy/certs/` inside the container

### External Compose Files (Supabase/Dify)

Complex services like Supabase and Dify maintain their own upstream docker-compose files:
- `start_services.py` handles cloning repos, preparing `.env` files, and starting services
- Each external service needs: `is_*_enabled()`, `clone_*_repo()`, `prepare_*_env()`, `start_*()` functions in `start_services.py`
- `scripts/utils.sh` provides `get_*_compose()` getter functions and `build_compose_files_array()` includes them
- `stop_all_services()` in `start_services.py` checks compose file existence (not profile) to ensure cleanup when a profile is removed
- All external compose files use the same project name (`-p localai`) so containers appear together
- **`docker-compose.override.yml`**: User customizations file (gitignored). Both `start_services.py` and `build_compose_files_array()` in `utils.sh` auto-detect and include it last (highest precedence). Users can override any service property without modifying tracked files.

### Secret Generation

The `scripts/03_generate_secrets.sh` script:
- Generates random passwords, JWT secrets, API keys, and encryption keys
- Creates bcrypt password hashes using Caddy's `hash-password` command
- Preserves existing user-provided values in `.env`
- Supports different secret types via `VARS_TO_GENERATE` map: `password:32`, `jwt`, `api_key`, `base64:64`, `hex:32`
- Preserves existing values on every run; the `--update` flag passed during updates is accepted but never parsed

## Architecture Patterns

### Docker Compose YAML Anchors

`docker-compose.yml` defines reusable anchors at the top:
- `x-logging: &default-logging` - `json-file` with `max-size: 1m`, `max-file: 1`
- `x-proxy-env: &proxy-env` - HTTP/HTTPS proxy vars from `GOST_PROXY_URL`/`GOST_NO_PROXY`
- `x-n8n: &service-n8n` - Full n8n service definition (reused by workers via `extends`)
- `x-ollama: &service-ollama` - Ollama service definition (reused by CPU/GPU variants)
- `x-init-ollama: &init-ollama` - Ollama model pre-puller (auto-pulls `qwen2.5:7b-instruct-q4_K_M` and `nomic-embed-text`)
- `x-n8n-worker-runner: &service-n8n-worker-runner` - Runner template for worker generation

### Healthchecks

Services should define healthchecks for proper dependency management:
```yaml
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD-SHELL", "wget -qO- http://localhost:8080/health || exit 1"]
  interval: 30s
  timeout: 10s
  retries: 5
```

### Service Dependencies

Use `depends_on` with conditions:
```yaml
depends_on:
  postgres:
    condition: service_healthy
  redis:
    condition: service_healthy
```

### Environment Variable Patterns

- All secrets/passwords end with `_PASSWORD` or `_KEY`
- All hostnames end with `_HOSTNAME`
- Password hashes end with `_PASSWORD_HASH`
- Use `${VAR:-default}` for optional vars with defaults
- Always wrap `${VAR}` interpolations in `docker-compose.yml` in double quotes: `"${VAR:-default}"`

### Profile Activation Logic

In bash scripts, check if a profile is active:
```bash
if is_profile_active "myservice"; then
  # Service-specific logic
fi
```

### Proxy Configuration (for AI services)

Services making outbound HTTP requests to AI APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) should use the shared proxy anchor:
```yaml
x-proxy-env: &proxy-env
  HTTP_PROXY: "${GOST_PROXY_URL:-}"
  HTTPS_PROXY: "${GOST_PROXY_URL:-}"
  NO_PROXY: "${GOST_NO_PROXY:-}"

services:
  myservice:
    environment:
      <<: *proxy-env  # Inherit proxy settings
```

**Important:** Healthchecks must bypass proxy:
```yaml
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD-SHELL", "http_proxy= https_proxy= HTTP_PROXY= HTTPS_PROXY= wget -qO- http://localhost:8080/health || exit 1"]
```

**GOST_NO_PROXY**: ALL service container names must be listed in `GOST_NO_PROXY` in `.env.example`. This prevents internal Docker network traffic from routing through the proxy. This applies to every service, not just those using `<<: *proxy-env`.

### Welcome Page Dashboard

The welcome page (`welcome/`) provides a post-install dashboard showing all active services:
- `scripts/generate_welcome_page.sh`: Generates `welcome/services.json` with service URLs, credentials, and metadata
- `welcome/app.js`: Contains `SERVICE_METADATA` object defining display properties (name, description, icon, color, category)
- Categories: `ai`, `database`, `monitoring`, `tools`, `infra`, `automation`
- Always use `json_escape "$VAR"` when building JSON to handle special characters

### Preserved Directories

Directories in `PRESERVE_DIRS` (defined in `scripts/utils.sh`) survive git updates:
- `python-runner/` - User's custom Python code

These are backed up before `git reset --hard` and restored after.

### Restart Behavior

`scripts/restart.sh` stops all services first, then starts external stacks (Supabase/Dify) separately before the main stack (10s delay between). This is required because external compose files use relative volume paths that resolve from their own directory.

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Service won't start after adding
1. Ensure profile is added to `COMPOSE_PROFILES` in `.env`
2. Check logs: `docker compose -p localai logs <service>`
3. Verify no port conflicts (no services should publish ports)
4. Ensure healthcheck is properly defined if service has dependencies

### Caddy certificate issues
- DNS must be configured before installation (wildcard A record: `*.yourdomain.com`)
- Check Caddy logs for certificate acquisition errors
- Verify `LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL` is set in `.env`

### Password hash generation fails
- Ensure Caddy container is running: `docker compose -p localai up -d caddy`
- Script uses: `docker exec caddy caddy hash-password --plaintext "$password"`

## File Locations

- Shared files accessible by n8n: `./shared` (mounted as `/data/shared` in n8n)
- n8n backup/workflows: `n8n/backup/workflows/` (mounted as `/backup` in n8n containers)
- n8n storage: Docker volume `localai_n8n_storage`
- Flowise storage: `~/.flowise` on host (mounted from user's home directory, not a named volume)
- Custom TLS certificates: `certs/` (gitignored, mounted as `/etc/caddy/certs/`)
- Caddy addon configs: `caddy-addon/site-*.conf` (gitignored, auto-imported)
- Service-specific volumes: Defined in `volumes:` section at top of `docker-compose.yml`
- Installation logs: stdout during script execution
- Service logs: `docker compose -p localai logs <service>`

## Testing Changes

### Syntax Validation

```bash
# Docker Compose syntax
docker compose -p localai config --quiet

# Bash script syntax (validate all key scripts)
bash -n scripts/utils.sh
bash -n scripts/git.sh
bash -n scripts/databases.sh
bash -n scripts/telemetry.sh
bash -n scripts/03_generate_secrets.sh
bash -n scripts/04_wizard.sh
bash -n scripts/05_configure_services.sh
bash -n scripts/07_final_report.sh
bash -n scripts/generate_welcome_page.sh
bash -n scripts/generate_n8n_workers.sh
bash -n scripts/generate_ollama_instances.sh
bash -n scripts/apply_update.sh
bash -n scripts/update.sh
bash -n scripts/install.sh
bash -n scripts/restart.sh
bash -n scripts/doctor.sh
bash -n scripts/setup_custom_tls.sh
bash -n scripts/setup_sysbox.sh
bash -n scripts/docker_cleanup.sh
```

### Full Testing

When modifying installer scripts:
1. Test on a clean Ubuntu 24.04 LTS system (minimum 4GB RAM / 2 CPU)
2. Verify all profile combinations work
3. Check that `.env` is properly generated
4. Confirm final report displays correct URLs and credentials
5. Test update script preserves custom configurations
